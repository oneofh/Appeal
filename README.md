# Crowdsourcing Appeal Project

This is a crowdsourcing appeal project helping everyone suffering from decisions of educational institutes. This project aims to let everyone know how to appeal to a decision and everyone can help to make the appeal stronger by a pull request on GitHub. Together, we can have a better educational system that protects better students' rights.

## Decision

According to the [Article 5 of Administrative Procedure Act (APA)](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1969/737_757_755/en#art_5), we can appeal a decision if:

1. the establishment, amendment or withdrawal of rights or obligations;
2. a finding of the existence, non-existence or extent of rights or obligations;
3. the rejection of applications for the establishment, amendment, withdrawal or finding of rights or obligations, or the dismissal of such applications without entering into the substance of the case.

## Procedure

If you want to know more about the appeal procedure, you can visit CRIEPF website:

## Language

The appeal must be written in one of Switzerland's national languages. Thanks to modern technology, such as [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) and [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com), we do not need to know those langauges to appeal a decision. 

## Cost

The cost is around 500 CHF for the ETH Appeals Commission if you lose the case.
