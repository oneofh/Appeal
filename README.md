# Crowdsourcing Appeal Project

This is a crowdsourcing appeal project helping everyone suffering from decisions of educational institutes. This project aims to let everyone know how to appeal to a decision and everyone can help to make the appeal stronger by a pull request on GitHub. Together, we can have a better educational system that protects better students' rights.

## Decision

According to the [Article 5 of Administrative Procedure Act (APA)](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1969/737_757_755/en#art_5), we can appeal a decision if:

1. the establishment, amendment or withdrawal of rights or obligations;
2. a finding of the existence, non-existence or extent of rights or obligations;
3. the rejection of applications for the establishment, amendment, withdrawal or finding of rights or obligations, or the dismissal of such applications without entering into the substance of the case.

## Right to Appeal
Any decision may be appealed to the ETH Internal Appeals Commission, P.O. Box, 3001 Berne, within 30 days of notification of the decision, including public holidays. The statement of appeal must state the conclusions, evidence and reasons in accordance with Art. 49 APA. It must be signed by the appellant or his representative. The contested decision and the documents used as evidence must be attached to the appeal. The appeal must be written in an official language of the Confederation. It must indicate the appellant's address or place of service in Switzerland. An advance on the costs of the proceedings is generally collected by the appeal authority. As a general rule, the costs of proceedings are borne by the unsuccessful party.
